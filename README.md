# Echo GraalVM

A simple Telegram bot that echoes messages back to the user.
The objective is to experiment with GraalVM while generating native-images from a Clojure application.

**Echoes only text messages**

## Usage

Local deploy - `linux/amd64`

1. Clone the repository
2. Rename the file `resources/config.edn.example` to `resources/config.edn`.
3. Fill the `resources/config.edn` file with your Telegram bot token.
4. Run the docker container: `docker compose up -d`

## Experiment Results

A simple Clojure application (a Telegram echo bot) deployed to a Docker container consuming less than 10 MiB of RAM.

`docker stats` output:
